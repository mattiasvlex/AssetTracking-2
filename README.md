## Asset Tracking

Simple console application to keep track of assets. This mini project was part of a course on EF Core and SQL Server at Lexicon Malm√∂.

A similar project was made in an earlier course on C#, where Lists were used instead (the project is named "MiniProject3").

Apart from the way to keep track of data, the Menu classes has been completely remade as well.
